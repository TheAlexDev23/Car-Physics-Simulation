# Car-Physics-Simulation
This is a copy (with some modifications) of [alexpro/Car-Physics-Simulation](https://github.com/alexpro0230/Car-Physcis-Simulation), rebuilt from scratch in unity.

This is a school project, nothing more.

Also please don't watch the code or the commit messages :) They're really bad. Again this is a project and I didn't focus on making things clean and organized because I would not be something really big.
